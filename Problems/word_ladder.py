Question: Word Ladder
Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary's word list, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`. 
Only one letter can be changed at a time, and each transformed word must exist in the word list. 
If no such sequence exists, return 0.
Example:
    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
    Output: 5
